                <p>Hello there! I'm Anirudh Hegde, a DevOps and open-source software enthusiast.
                    <br>
                <p>
                    My journey into the world of tech began in 2021, during the COVID lockdown. With Python as
                    my trusty sidekick, I embarked on a quest to implement small projects using streamlit. Along the
                    way,
                    I started learning DevOps and soon realized windows is not much supportive in using docker commands
                    due to poor CLI. This led me to discover the magical realm of Linux, and I quickly adopted my first
                    distro - Ubuntu. It was love at first sight! Since then, I've been using Linux for all my
                    development
                    escapades,and I've developed a deep understanding of the system and then I switched to Linux Mint.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I honed my skills in Python and Java. Then, I dabbled into the realm of competitive programming and
                    started solving problems, participated in CodeChef weekly contest and out of 5, I was able to solve
                    2-3 coding problems. However, I soon realized my passion is devoted to Open-source software. I came
                    to know about Open-source software while I was listening to the podcast on Twitter spaces. Then I
                    started to basic contributions to the project and endeavoured to showcase the enchanting realm of my
                    GitHub profile.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in spring-boot and understanding DevOps principles. As a guy
                    who loves free stuff, I've spent a lot of time hunting for open-source software to make valuable
                    contributions. I love challenges and debugging errors, at the application level.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm currently on the lookout for exciting full-time opportunities in the field of DevOps. So, if
                    you're looking for someone who can play around with the knobs of DevOps, and debug errors while
                    cracking
                    a joke
                    or two, feel free to reach out! So, Let's connect, contribute, and create something amazing
                    together.
                    At last, I will get to diversify my network
                    with amazing
                    folks.
                </p>
